"You became the light on the dark side of me",
"Love remained a drug that's the high and not the pill",
"But did you know that when it snows",
"My eyes become large and the light that you shine can be seen.",
"BAY-BEHHH",
"I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the gray.",
"Ooh",
"The more I get of you the stranger it feels, yeahhh",
"And now that your rose is in bloom, a light hits the gloom on the gray",
"There is so much a man can tell you, so much he can say",
"You remain my power, my pleasure, my pain",
"To me you're like a growing addiction that I can't deny",
"Won't you tell me is that healthy, baby?",
"I've been kissed by a rose on the gray",
"I've been kissed by a rose",
"...And if I should fall along the way",
"...been kissed by a rose on the gray.",
"Yes I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the gray"
