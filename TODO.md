#TODO:

* include Easter egg so a certain phone number sends you to the YouTube video for "Kiss From A Rose"<br>
* verify that the number being input is an actual phone number<br>
* if the number can't be texted due to a STOP request, show an error<br>
* flash a message or create a modal/popup when text is sent<br>
* fix it so the stupid background actually shows up on heroku<br>
* ~~pretty it up with bootstrap~~<br>
* migrate to postgres<br>
* ~~figure out how to read from secrets.yml~~<br>
